Global Challenges

Jessica Thompson, a renowned biologist from the University of Edenbridge, attended the International Conference on Climate Change held at the Grand Liberty Hall in Berlin. During this event, held on March 15, 2023, she spoke about the importance of sustainable practices in preserving biodiversity. Jessica, who is 42 years old, emphasized collaboration between countries and organizations to tackle global challenges.

Her presentation, "Harnessing Natural Solutions for a Sustainable Future," highlighted successful projects in the Amazon Basin and how they could serve as models worldwide. The primary focus was on the Indigenous Peoples' Coalition, which has been pivotal in implementing changes with a minimal budget of â‚¬50,000. She cited data from over 300 studies conducted in various languages, including Spanish and Portuguese, which show significant ecological benefits from these practices.

Jessica proposed expanding these initiatives to other regions like Scandinavia, where similar environmental conditions prevail. She concluded her talk by suggesting a meeting in June 2024, in Sydney, to further discuss global strategies for sustainability. This proposal was well-received by the 150 participants who represented different countries and organizations committed to environmental conservation.
